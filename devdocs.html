      Remember: You can always use Mongo shell to insert new attributes onto
      document objects by using an empty object in the `find` search and using
      .update({ $set: {attr: {}}})

      how to set a nested object

      C - CREATE
      <br />
      <small
        >When defining a create route, make sure you start by doing the Redux
        constants (CRUD for all). The route itself should create the project and
        return any projects that exist (no point in wasting the request)
      </small>
    </p>
    <p>
      R - READ
      <br />
      <small
        >All routes should basically do this, but this one only contains the
        `read`. Use Mongo `.find()`</small
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      U - UPDATE
      <small
        >This route should update an existing document (often named _entity in
        the UI) and return all documents for the account. It's okay to use
        `findOneAndReplace` <i>AS LONG AS the data is not sensitive!</i> For
        example, you wouldn't want to use `findOneAndReplace` on an account,
        because the user could edit the account using the browser's cookies and
        change a variable that would, for example, set an access level or
        something like that that the user would otherwise have to pay
        for.</small

      D - DELETE
      <small
        >This route should delete an existing document (often named _entity in
        the UI) and return all documents for the account</small
      >
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, all routes should return a READ unless they're connected to a
      socket (in which case you have to emit a socket event, because there's no
      sense in wasting the response.
